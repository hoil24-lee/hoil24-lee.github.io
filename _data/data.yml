career-profile:
  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I currently work as a Data Scientist / AI Engineer at Samsung SDS, focused on LLM application development, including RAG systems and agentic workflows.
    **Currently employed, and open to new opportunities.**

    Before joining Samsung SDS, I completed my Ph.D. in Mathematical Sciences at KAIST, where I studied deep neural networks with inter-node dependency and heavy-tailed distributions.
    I have a solid foundation in probability theory and statistics, which I apply to develop robust AI solutions.

    Professional interests:
      - Large language models and their applications, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and AI agents
      - Data analysis, machine learning, and deep neural networks with heavy-tailed behavior
      - Probability theory -- infinite and finite exchangeability, random graphs and graph limits

    Knowledge & Skills:
      - Theoretical foundations -- Probability Theory, Deep Learning, Statistics
      - Core skills -- LangChain & LangGraph, FastAPI, PyTorch
